A small AppleScript applet for taking AVCHD containered MTS files and making them usable in FCP7.

My college had a problem with its expensive broadcast cameras. While money had been thrown at what was hot 5 years ago, no one had thought about a reliable production pipeline. The footage created by these cameras was AVCHD, which while fine, happens to not always play ball with old versions of Final Cut Pro. Using FFMpeg, I wrote an AppleScript script that should allow you to convert files from that specific camera (and likely a lot of AVCHD-supporting cameras) into something more usable for FCP7.

Now if you're using Final Cut Pro X you haven't needed this since the really early days. Premiere Pro probably does, but admittedly if you're using Premiere you're probably on Windows because it's a million times faster on Windows. 

## How To Use

1. Open the Applet. I've not used a Mac much since finishing Film A Level, so whether it works on new OS X version I don't know.
2. Find the file you want to convert and Open it.
3. Wait for the confirmation screen to pop up.
4. Import this new file into Final Cut Pro and it should all work fine.
